# Motivating children to learn effectively: exploring the value of intrinsic integration in educational games (Study 1)

<details>
    <summary><b>What was done?</b></summary>
    <p> The first study in the article by Habgood and Ainsworth (2011) investigates the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic teaching materials integrated into an educational video game. The game, Zombie Division, is aimed towards 7–11-year-olds and is focused on teaching division. In the game, the player must pick which weapon to use to beat the skeletons in the room. The player has to pick one of three available weapons, in order to defeat the skeletons. In the intrinsic version of the game, the skeletons have a number on their chest and the players can pick the right weapon based on what the divisor of that number is. In the extrinsic version of the game, the weapon is chosen based on symbols on the skeletons’ chests, and the mathematical task is presented as a multiple-choice question at the end of each room. Thus, in the intrinsic version the educational content is directly integrated into the gameplay, while in the extrinsic version it is disconnected from the tasks of the game.</p>
    <p> The study included a total of 58 participants (30 girls and 28 boys) aged 7 years 1 month to 8 years 10 months. The study used a two-factor mixed design, meaning that the children were divided into three groups for the intrinsic, extrinsic and control conditions so that the gender, age and pre-test score of the children between those groups did not differ. The game in the control group only included fighting the skeletons with the given symbols, without the added multiple-choice questions. Additionally, the children all completed a pre, post and delayed test. The test was completed on a computer and included 63 multiple choice questions with four answer options. After the first three questions that were used for interface practice, the children had 15 minutes to finish the questionnaires.</p>
    <p> The study started with a pre-test, which was followed by two game sessions. After the first game sessions, the groups went through a teacher led reflection, which consisted of more traditional teaching content for division calculations. After the reflection, the children had more game sessions, and the post-test. Lastly, they had the final game session to bring the total game time up to 135 minutes, followed by the delayed test. The tests and the game sessions were spread over 34 days. </p>

    <summary><b>What were the main results?</b></summary>
    <p>The study found a significant main effect of time. The post-test scores were higher than the pre-test scores. However, the post-test scores and delayed-test scores did not show a significant difference. Additionally, a time by game interaction was found, showing that all groups improved over time. The intrinsic group significantly improved from the pre-test to the post-test (mean 15.91, p <0.001), as well as from the post-test to the delayed test (mean 7.04, p <0.04). The extrinsic group only improved from the pre-test to the post-test (mean 10.97, p <0.006), and the control group improved between the pre-test and the delayed test (mean 8.78, p <0.03). Lastly, it was found that the intrinsic group scored significantly higher than the extrinsic group or the control group.</p>

    <summary><b>Conclusion</b></summary>
    <p>In conclusion, the study shows that the intrinsic integration of educational content might be more effective and preferable to extrinsic integration, since it seems to provide better learning outcomes. This could be explained through increased attention, arousal, and affect, which are all believed to lead to higher learning performance. Additionally, it is possible that the children in the intrinsic game condition implemented better strategies to solve the calculations, as it has been shown that fantasy games can inspire children to use more systematic strategies as well as to express more exploratory behaviour. Furthermore, the improvement in the control condition, supported by the teacher’s statements, implies that the motivational factor from participating in the game sessions is a good indicator for the use of educational games in schools.</p>
