## Serious games learning effectiveness: The case of It's a Deal!

<details>
    <summary><b>What was done?</b></summary>
    <p>Guillen-Nieto and Aleson-Carbornell (2012) examine some factors influencing the learning effectiveness of the serious game “It's a Deal!”. The game serves to teach intercultural business communication between Spaniards and Britons in business settings in which English is used as the lingua franca. Two main questions are addressed: First, it is examined whether the intercultural awareness, intercultural knowledge and intercultural communicative competence in business English improved after playing the game. Second, factors influencing the improvement or the failure of improvement are analyzed. The authors suppose that the immersive, all-embracing, and interactive learning environment of the game develops and enhances the users’ intercultural communicative competence.</p>
    <p> Aiming to improve intercultural business communication, the game is designed to serve a target group of students. Therefore, the participants of the study were 50 students of English Studies at the University of Alicante of the academy year 2010-2011. The study works with qualitative and quantitative data. It started with a pre-test questionnaire assessing with 24 items the previous knowledge of intercultural communication in business settings split in the three categories: intercultural awareness, knowledge, and communication competence. Afterwards, the students played the game and they were informally observed to collect information about their engagement, attention, involvement, enjoyment, difficulties, and the time needed to complete the video game. After one week, the students filled out the post-test questionnaire consisting of general feedback, experience evaluation and a post-knowledge test using the same items as in the pre-test questionnaire to assess the advance in intercultural communication.</p>

    <summary><b>What were the main results?</b></summary>
    <p> The collected data was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. There are three main findings of this study. </p>
    <p>1. The informal observations indicate that the students were enthusiastic, motivated, and fully involved in the game. This was shown by forgetting about the time, letting themselves go or bursting out laughing while playing the game. The biographical data shows that they have an intermediate level of English and the majority had never had any training in intercultural business communication. Therefore, they were a suitable group for playing this game. </p>
    <p>2. The comparison of pre- and post-test questionnaires shows significant differences between the results on all three variables of interest [intercultural awareness (t = 2.460, p = .016), intercultural knowledge (t = 3.057, p = .003)] with the most impressive effects on intercultural communicative competence (t = 4.461, p < .001). In summary, “It's a Deal” fulfilled its purpose to improve intercultural learning.</p>
    <p>3. The analyses of factors influencing the improvement consisted of correlations between six variables making up the experiential test (instructional content, game dimensions, game cycle, debriefing, perceived educational value, transfer of learnt skills and intrinsic motivation) and each of the three variables of the knowledge test. However, the results were not significant. Looking at the mean scores for each of the variables from the experiential test, it reveals that these are quite high and very similar suggesting that the learning effectiveness in this game results from the balanced combination of the six dimensions.</p>

    <summary><b>Conclusion</b></summary>
    <p>To summarize, this study shows that “It's a Deal!” is an effective tool for teaching intercultural communication between Spaniards and Britons in business settings in which English is used as the lingua franca. The effectiveness results from a balanced use of several factors considered by the creation of this serious game. At this point it is important to highlight that “It’s a deal!” is not designed in a visually attractive way like other serious games are. The content is educational, and the objectives are clearly pedagogic. It is didactic and not nice to look at. Having this in mind, one can say that the immersive, all-embracing and interactive learning environment of the game may improve the competence of the students although it is not a “nice and attractive” environment to look at but a didactical one.</p>
