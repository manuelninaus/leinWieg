## Short Review

<details>
    <summary><b>Introduction</b></summary>
    <p>One goal of educators is to assist students in achieving increased levels of understanding in their content and skills areas. Educators can use information and computer technologies to do so. These tools are considered some of the most powerful teaching tools supporting student learning (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2010). This study focuses on the broad category of educational gaming. In this category, there are several types of games that include Serious Educational Games (SEG), Educational Simulations (ES), and Serious Games (SG). There are several reasons why these educational simulations are of interest to the education community. For example, the games are designed in an engaging way. Engaging nature is an advantage because it helps to connect the cognition and psychological reward systems by stimulating the areas of the brain which are associated with attention and arousal (Schore, 2000).</p>
    <p>Regarding the use of technology in the classroom there is a “more is better” approach. A positive relationship between technology and learning is often taken for granted. Possible factors influencing the success and shortcomings of various technologies in the domain of education are left unexamined (Pearce et al., 2012). Therefore, there are conflicting results about the value and the characteristics of the games and factors that determine the outcomes.</p>
    <p>The meta-analysis by Lamb et al. (2017) aims to compare the outcomes of the different games used in the classroom context and furthermore, to examine the characteristics of the games which moderate the effectiveness of their use.</p>

    <summary><b>What is this meta-analysis about?</b></summary>
    <p>In the presented meta-analysis the authors focus on characterizing and comparing outcomes related to different interactive educational games which are currently used in schools and universities. There are several different types of interactive educational games such as serious educational games, serious games, and educational simulations. The authors use the following definitions to disentangle the three types of games:
    <ul>
        <li>Educational simulations = electronic representations of real phenomena acting as practice for tasks in the real world</li>
        <li>Serious games = training broad series of tasks while using real life examples; electronic versions included</li>
        <li>Serious educational games = similar to serious games but incorporate specific a priori pedagogical approaches to not only train tasks but teach content as well</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>All of them have in common that they should impact the learning results in a positive way. However, the authors suppose that the impact of the games might differ regarding different categories of outcome measurements such as affect, cognition, or achievement. This might be due to the special characteristics of each educational game like SEG including a priori pedagogical approach. Therefore, the authors want to examine with this systematic review and meta-analysis the following two research questions:
    <ol>
        <li>Does the use of Serious Educational Games (SEGs), Serious Games (SGs), and educational simulations (ES) increase affective, cognitive, or achievement outcomes in the preschool through university (P-20) learning environment?</li>
        <li>How effective has the use of SEGs, SGs, and ES been at improving students' affect, cognition, and achievement within the P-20 learning environments?</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The studies were categorized into three categories of effect: cognitive, affective and achievement, and by using standardized mean difference effect sizes the effectiveness of these categories was compared. First all game types were compared together and in the second step, the authors checked with pairwise comparisons for differences between the different game types regarding the three outcome categories.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the authors wanted to examine which characteristics of the different games influence the effectiveness of their use on the three outcome categories. So, they had a closer look on the foci of study interventions to determine relevant moderating factors to answer the following third research question: 
    <ol start="3">
        <li>What characteristics of SEGs, SGs, and ES in education are most important for determining the effectiveness of their use on student affect, cognition, and achievement?</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p> </p>

    <summary><b>What are the results of the meta-analysis?</b></summary>
    <p>Analysis of 49 data points from 28 studies suggest that using SEGs, SGs and ES result in higher cognitive gains and increases in positive affect. The outcomes do not differ in a significant way when comparing ES (d = .63), SG (d = .5) and SEG (d = 0.79). The authors suggest that the differences in the effect sizes result because SEG include specific pedagogical approaches during the game while the other games add the pedagogy after the game is complete. Besides, the three game types do not differ from traditional instruction.</p>
    <p>The authors also compared the outcomes categorized by learning focus of the intervention i.e. affective, cognitive and skill based. The analysis shows a cumulative medium (i.e. for all game types together) effect for cognition (d = .67) and affect (d = .51) and large effect for skills based training (d = .81).</p>
    <p>Going more into detail, post-hoc analysis shows differences between SEG, ES and EG regarding the learning focus of the intervention. SEGs have a greater effect on cognitive outcomes compared to SG and ES. SEGs have similar effects to SGs with regard to affective and skill based learning. ES are mostly associated with effects on cognition. The results suggest that the differences appear due to the use of three-dimensional immersive environments in SEGs and SGS. These environments seem to result in a greater cognitive stimulation, immersion and some more features which ease the process of practicing and learning.</p>
    <p>In addition, the authors run a moderator analysis to understand the differences in outcomes better. The findings of this analysis can be summarized as follows: learning is stimulated best by including pedagogical approaches while using three dimensional environments. Students that benefit the most are mostly in middle school, followed by the age group of high school students. The university level shows no significant outcomes.</p>

    <summary><b>Quality of the meta-analysis (MAGIC)</b></summary>
    <p>We evaluate the meta-analysis answering five questions and using Abelson Criteria (1995) also called the MAGIC criteria.</p>
    <p><u>Magnitude</u><br>  
The meta-analysis shows overall positive effects of all three game types on the relevant outcomes. Effect sizes are between d = .5 for SG, d = .63 for ES and d = 0.79 for SEG. There are no significant differences between these sizes. The effect sizes can be classified as medium to large. When the effects of the games are compared split by outcome, large effects show for skills (d = .81) and medium effects for cognition (d = .67) and affect (d = .51). This suggests that games are a powerful tool to increase learning.</p>
    <p>However, the analysis of moderators shows that there are factors that influence the effects. These factors need to be considered when games are developed and used, because it is shown that just using a game does not guarantee large effects.</p>
    <p><u>Articulation</u><br>
In the study, different game types outcomes (skills, affect, and cognitions), dimensionality and learning environment are used as moderators. There are differences between the game types as well as between the other moderators for all three outcome categories. This classification and analysis allow quite specific conclusions. However, it must be noted that the methodological part explaining the  analyses and the division into categories are not precise and easy to understand. In addition, there are inconsistencies in the naming of various categories. It is therefore difficult to understand the results in detail.</p>    
<p><u>Generality</u><br>
The meta-analysis includes studies for learners of different age groups, studies that use games in different subjects, and, of course, studies with different types of games. Overall, the results show a positive effect of games on learning outcomes and suggest a quite general effect. However, the moderator analyses in the results show that there are significant differences For example: based on the included studies, games do not have a positive effect on university levels. Also the effects of the game types on cognition, skills and affect differ significantly among themselves. Therefore, the overall positive effect of the games can only be generalized to a limited extent.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that the aim of the meta-analysis was to include as many studies as possible. For this purpose, the analysis includes quasi-experimental studies and the definition criteria for the game types were quite broad. For example, no distinction was made between simulations and educational simulations. Therefore, many questions remain open as to what the game types and modes that lead to the largest effects are. In addition, although five moderators were considered, this is only a small sample of the potentially influencing factors. For example, time of exposure was not considered. Further research is needed to make the results more generalizable.</p>
    <p><u>Interestingness</u><br>
Lamb and colleagues' meta-analysis is scientifically significant because it systematically and reliably estimates the effectiveness of gaming on learning outcomes in addition to existing reviews and literature. It is also interesting that it refuses the "the more the better" approach, as it shows that games do not produce effects that are significantly different from the effects of traditional teaching methods.</p>
<p>What is particularly relevant about the study is that it is the first study to compare different game types and modes rather than examine them isolated. Therefore, the study fills a gap in previous research. The moderator analyses provide more detailed insights into the factors that need to be considered for positive effects on learning. In addition, these results can also be used to derive further research to better understand the effects of games and the factors that influence them. For example, further investigation is needed to answer the question why three-dimensional games result in greater outcomes than two-dimensional games.</p>
    <p>Another aspect why this study is relevant focuses more on the practice.The meta-analysis shows that SEG achieves more positive effects overall than ES especially in cognition and affect. This is especially interesting for the developers of games and the teachers who select the games, because it is more likely to use SEG than simulations in order to achieve great learning outcomes.</p>
    <p><u>Credibility</u><br>
The transparency and justification of the methodical procedure must be rated as critical.</p>
    <p>While the criteria for study search and selection are still well documented, it becomes increasingly difficult in the course of the meta-analysis to understand how many studies the analyses are based on. Furthermore, documentation according to the PRISMA criteria is missing completely. 
</p>
    <p>In the area of coding and analysis, more detailed information would be needed for better comprehensibility. For example, it is often not clear what is meant by categories and how the studies were classified into categories. Besides, the individual analyses are not described precisely and therefore the results are difficult to understand in detail. In addition, there are contradictions in the report of the results. For example, different names are used for the outcome category "skills'' and the effect sizes differ in various sections of the paper.</p>
    <p>On the positive side, a large number of studies were included and non-published reports were also taken into account to prevent publication bias. However, the analysis for publication bias shows that this is nevertheless present in the presented meta-analysis.</p>

    <summary><b>Conclusion</b></summary>
    <p>The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that games are a powerful tool to ease learning and to gain higher outcomes regarding cognition, affect and behavior. There are positive effects for all types of games on the three outcome categories. However, one has to keep in mind that there are several differences in the results for the game types and that especially the use of SEG results in positive outcomes regarding cognition and skills. Besides, the analysis of moderating factors show that the learning is stimulated best by including pedagogical approaches while using three dimensional environments. Students that benefit the most are mostly in middle school, followed by the age group of high school students. The university level shows no significant outcomes.</p>
<p>This shows that games cannot be used blindly. The teachers and instructors have to keep an eye on the age of the students they teach and pick games that include pedagogical approaches and three dimensional environments to achieve the best outcomes. “The more the better” when it comes to games in teaching environments should be questioned. However, the analysis also points to a gap in research. It is the first study comparing the three game types and the potential moderating factors. More research is necessary to understand which type works best for different tasks, skills and learning objectives. Besides, it must be further examined how the games should be integrated into the student's learning experience to facilitate learning to the fullest extent. Based on this research it is for example not possible to say, if added on pedagogy could make up for the missing pedagogy approach in ES and SG compared to SEG.</p>
