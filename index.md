Comparing the effects of Serious Educational Games (SEG), Educational Simulations (ES), and Serious Games (SG) for students' learning performance. 

### Target Group 

- Teachers and professors
- Ministry of education (education, research financing)
- (Serious) game developers


### Average Effect Size 
- Large effect for skill based training (d=.81).
- Medium effect for cognition (d=.67) and affect (d=.51).

### Additional Remarks 
- SEGs, SGs and ES are powerful tools influencing outcomes regarding cognition, affect, and skills
- SEGs show a greater effect when compared to the other game types in cognitive outcomes and similar effects to SGs in affective and skills based learning, Simulations illustrate effects associated with cognition.
- Moderator analysis shows five key findings stimulating learning: Game type, mode, learning environment, outcome and game type moderate the effect of the games/simulations
